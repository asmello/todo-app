# Todo App

This is a simple Todo web application, intended to provide a reference for learning React. Unlike the Tic Tac Toe example, this app has enough complexity to demonstrate how multiple components fit together, as well as some common features like routing and local persistence.

The code in this repository is largely based on [the tutorial](https://ibaslogic.com/react-tutorial-for-beginners/) by Ibas Majid, with some key differences:

* All logic is written in Typescript
* React Router V6 is used instead of the obsolete V5
* Most code has been refactored for better adherence to what this author understands as good programming practices

Functionally, the app itself should behave and look virtually identical to the original implementation by Majid.

## Tests

As in Majid's version, this project doesn't currently implement tests. Contributions welcome.
